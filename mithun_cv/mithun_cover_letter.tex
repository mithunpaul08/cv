Hello,

\bigskip

\smallskip
My name is Mitch. I am a final year PhD student at the University of Arizonaâ€™s Department of Computer Science, where I am advised by Dr.Mihai Surdeanu.
I am looking for an assistant-professor faculty position and in support of my  application I am submitting herewith my Curriculum Vitae and research statement.\\


In brief, my current research focuses on natural language processing. Specifically,I focus on creation of neural network based architectures for textual entailment systems. My most recent work, published in the recent 2021 NAACL Conference, was on creation of a neural network architecture for domain transferable fact verification. I have also published in other NLP conferences like EMNLP, LREC etc. In my PhD dissertation I am focusing on zero shot techniques in neural networks to be utilized in a cross-domain evaluation of natural language inference problems.\\

\flushleft{Thank You\\}
